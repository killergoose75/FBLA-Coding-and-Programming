This application as made by Liam Goss from Redwood High School, Visalia, CA.
This project was coded in Python and used a module called PyInstaller to convert the .py to an .EXE.
As a result, PyInstaller .exe's only work on the architecture it was made on so this application will ONLY run on Windows 10, 64 bit computers.
The .py source code, student photos, and CSV files are located in 'src'.
The .exe executable file is located in 'bin' then 'dist'
The documentation is located in 'doc'.
For an in-depth tutorial and list of features, see the doc folder.
For any and all '.md' files present in the project, a '.txt' copy is provided for ease.
